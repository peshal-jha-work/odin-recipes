        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Quick and easy sugar cookies! They are really good, plain or with candies in them. <br> My friend uses chocolate mints on top, and they're great!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small bowl, <br> stir together flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. <br> Beat in egg and vanilla. Gradually blend 
                in the dry ingredients. Roll rounded <br>
                teaspoonfuls of dough into balls, and place onto ungreased cookie sheets.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bake 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden. <br> Let stand on cookie sheet two minutes before removing to cool on wire racks.</li>
